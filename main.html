  <h2>Feedback control of online ads</h2>

  <div class="left_col">

    Say an online publisher charges for impressions of your
    advertisement. The price you set determines the number of
    impressions.  The book
    [https://github.com/oreillymedia/feedback_control_for_computer_systems
    Feedback Control for Computer Systems] (FCCS) suggests an
    algorithm to adjust the price to achieve a target number of
    impressions.

  </div>

  <div class="right_col">

    The feedback system below forms the error between the reported and
    the target number of impressions. The error is processed by the
    controller and changes the price to reduce the error. Here we
    simulate a (modified) example from FCSS that runs in the browser.

  <div class="clear"></div>

  <div class="left_col">

    The publisher&mdash;the number of impressions for a given
    price&mdash;is modelled as a random variable whose mean and range
    vary logarithmically.
 
  </div>

  <div class="right_col">

    The code for the publisher below can be edited and run
    (shift+enter after edit). The plot shows how impressions are
    related to price (note that it changes with each run).

  </div>

  <div class="clear"></div>

  <div class="left_col">
    <div data-file="publisher.coffee"></div>
  </div>    

  <div class="right_col">
    <div data-eval="publisher.coffee"></div>
  </div>

  <div class="clear"></div>

  <div class="left_col">

    For the controller we use simple integration. The overall state
    diagram (with delay operator $z^{-1}$) is then as shown below.
    Here $r$ is the target number of impressions, $k_i$ is the
    integrator gain and $p()$ is the model of the publisher from above
    (the delay following $p()$ models once-daily reporting).
 
  </div>

  <div class="right_col">

    The two states are the outputs of the delay blocks. The transition
    equations are found by tracing the block diagram
    until either an input or another state is found:
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    x_1[l+1] & = x_1[l] + k_i(r-x_2[l]) \\
    x_2[l+1] & = p\left(x_1[l] + k_i(r-x_2[l]) \right)
    \end{aligned}
    $$

  </div>

  <div class="clear"></div>

  <figure align="center">
    <img id="system2" class="system">
  </figure>

  <div class="clear"></div>

  <div class="left_col">

    The code below simulates the system (time step is 1 day), with the
    important results shown on the right. The red trace shows the
    target number of impressions&mdash;which jumps from 100 to 200
    impressions on the 30th day. The green trace shows the reported
    impressions (state $x_1$).
 
  </div>

  <div class="right_col">

    The second plot shows the change in price (state $x_2$). Because
    of the logrithmic nature of the publisher model, the price to
    double the number of impressions is far greater than double. Click
    on the code, then shift+enter to see the random variation.
